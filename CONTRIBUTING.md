#Contributing

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on Github.

## Pull Requests

PSR-2 Coding Standard - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install PHP Code Sniffer.

Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

Create feature branches - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

Happy coding!
